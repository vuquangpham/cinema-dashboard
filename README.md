## Cineme Dashboard

Helloooo there, welcome to my respository - **cinema dashboard**. I have built this project for my self learning - about HTML/CSS/Javascript/Module Bundler and more pattern on it. In this project, what are things that we can do? Yeah, I have super super notes below that, please read it before you use this project üòÇ. Hope you have fun when travel throught my project

### What can we do here?

- Search for movies
- Get detail about movie
- Bookmark to watch later

### UI Design

I'm just coverd UI design on Dribble into HTML/CSS. So, I'm just do a little bit. If you like this design, please contact this owner on Dribble.

- UI Design: [Dribble]('https://dribbble.com/shots/15401391-Cinema-Dashboard-Design/attachments/7166749?mode=media')

### API Endpoint

- I have used API from [omdbapi](https://www.omdbapi.com/). You have to generate an API key to use this API. I have updated my API key into my respository without env variable, so you can use my API key to generate movie.

### Pattern

Coding with pattern, it helps me a lot, especially in structuring file/folder, managing and expanding my code in the nearly future.

I have used 2 popular pattern:

- MVC (model - view - controller) Pattern to structure Javascript code.
- 7 - 1 Architecture CSS.

### Module Bundler

- Webpack is my choice üòç.
- You can use another module bundler:
  - Parcel (easy for newbie without config)
  - Browserify

### Naming Convention

In my mine, I think the most difficult thing when I start to code, maybe in coding time, is how to naming variable, naming classname to have significant meaning. So in my project, I have to use 2 naming convention:

- For HTML/CSS, I have used BEM - Block Element Modified for classname
- For Javascript code, camelCase is my best choice.

### Important Notes:

I haven't used CSS prefix for my project until now. Because I have more thing to do than do it. So if you want this project to run in any environment, please go to **NPM**, download and config to use it. I think it's very easy for you to do it. Thank you for my inconvenience üò•.
